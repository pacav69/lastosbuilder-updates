# Lastos builder updates

## introduction

With the introduction of Windows 11 the Lastos builder requires a few tweaks in order to work because of the hardware requirements such as TPM 2.0, secure boot, minimum RAM and HDD in Virtualbox.

## Usage

## MyOSBuilder

In the MyOSBuilder folder there are updated files that can be used in your exiting builder. 

* Create a backup directory named "BackupLast20BuilderScripts"
* In Last20Builder move the extension of cmd and txt files to "BackupLast20Scripts" directory.
* Copy the files in MyOSBuilder directory to your Last20Builder directory.

## Clone

To clone create a subdirectory and use the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/pacav69/lastosbuilder-updates 

this will copy the files to your computer into the created subdirectory.


## Documentation WIP (work In Progress)

I've included the instructions for using the last os builder in a new format.
