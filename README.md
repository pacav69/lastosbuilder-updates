# Lastos builder updates

# introduction
With the introduction of Windows 11 the Lastos builder requires a few tweaks in order to work because of the hardware requirements such as TPM 2.0, secure boot, minimum RAM and HDD in Virtualbox.

## Usage
* Copy the cmd files into the root direct of last builder on your computer.
* copy the files  VHDSize_Win11.txt and VirtMem_Win11.txt into the settings directory.

This will allow Virtualbox to startup and run the windows 11 setup.

# Documentation WIP (work In Progress)
I've included the instructions for using the last os builder in a new format.


# Clone
To clone create a subdirectory and use the following command:

		git clone https://github.com/pacav69/lastosbuilder-updates 

this will copy the files to your computer into the created subdirectory.
